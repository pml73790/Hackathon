Team members: Vi Tran, Tri Vo, Torsa Rahman, My Ly.
Purpose of the project: The purpose of our project is to make a user-friendly web service for
users to be able to track their money goals and be able to budget efficiently. We are also using
chatbots to help users be able to ask questions and get advice regarding their finances.
Tools utilized: VS code, github, Mongodb, deepseek, google, geeksforgeeks, stackflow,
w3school
Problems we ran into and how we overcame them: We ran into many problems and challenges
while doing this project. The first was uploading to the git hub. For the person who wanted to
make the first commit, for some reason, we couldn't push directly from vs code to Git Hub. They
shared it to Google Drive and when everyone opened and ran it, there were errors and
dependency issues because not all the files uploaded and some of the folders didn't either.
Another problem is figuring out how to implement a database into our website. We fix this by
getting help from AI and then look some stuff on the internet to learn more about the databases.
Cred to any public frameworks: None
How to run our project: The project under branch vi-hack is our final project. To run it upload the
folder onto vs code. Type “npm install” into the terminal. Then type “npm run dev”. This will give
a local host link that you can push to get to out project
