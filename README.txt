Team members: Vi Tran, Tri Vo, Torsa Rahman, My Ly
Purpose of the project: The purpose of our project is to make a user-friendly web service for
users to be able to track their money goals and be able to budget efficiently. We are also using
chatbots to help users be able to ask questions and get advice regarding their finances.

Tools utilized: VS code, GitHub, MongoDB, ChatGPT

We ran into several problems during the event and one of them is with GitHub since some
group members do not have experience with it. This problem was somewhat solved with Tri helping
everyone out with Git. Another problem is figuring out how to implement a database like MongoDB into our website.
Vi fixes this by getting help from AI and then look some stuff on the internet to learn more about the databases.

This was the first Hackathon for most members of the team, so everyone end up learning a lots. We all become
more experience with web development like My and Torsa learn more about the frontend while Tri and Vi learn
more about the backend. 

Cred to any public frameworks: None

How to run our project: The project under branch vi-hack is our final project. To run it upload the
folder onto vs code and get the env file from the zip file submitted 
to devpost. Type “npm install” into the terminal. Then type “npm run dev”. This will give
a local host link that you can push to get to out project.
